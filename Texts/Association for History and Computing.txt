The AHC is an international organization with the aim of promoting the use of computers in all types of historical study, both for teaching and research. 
It was originally proposed at a conference at [[Westfield College]], [[University of London]], in March 1986. It was founded during a second conference at the same location a year later in March 1987.

The Association oversees a journal, ''[[History and Computing]]'', published by the [[Edinburgh University Press]].
