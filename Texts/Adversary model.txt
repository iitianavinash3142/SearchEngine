==Common adversaries==

The three common adversaries are the oblivious adversary, the adaptive online adversary, and the adaptive offline adversary.

The '''oblivious adversary''' is sometimes referred to as the weak adversary. This adversary knows the algorithm's code, but does not get to know the randomized results of the algorithm.

The '''adaptive online adversary''' is sometimes called the medium adversary. This adversary must make its own decision before it is allowed to know the decision of the algorithm. 

The '''adaptive offline adversary''' is sometimes called the strong adversary. This adversary knows everything, even the random number generator. This adversary is so strong that randomization does not help against him.

==Important results==
From S. Ben-David, A. Borodin, [[Richard Karp|R. Karp]], G. Tardos, A. Wigderson we have:
* If there is a randomized algorithm that is α-competitive against any adaptive offline adversary then there also exists an α-competitive deterministic algorithm.
* If G is a c-competitive randomized algorithm against any adaptive online adversary, and there is a randomized d-competitive algorithm against any oblivious adversary, then G is a randomized (c * d)-competitive algorithm against any adaptive offline adversary.
