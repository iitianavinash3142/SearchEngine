'''[[List of Hybrid Digimon#Arbormon|Arbormon]]''' is a fictional character in [[Digimon]] and is a major character in [[Digimon: Digital Monsters (anime)#Digimon Frontier|Digimon Frontier]].

==Description==

'''Arbormon''' is the Legendary Warrior of Wood, using the power of [[AncientTroiamon]]. His Beast Hybrid form is '''[[List of Hybrid Digimon#Petaldramon|Petaldramon]]'''.

A wooden android Digimon modeled after a [[Karakuri]] puppet, Arbormon is notorious for seemingly randomly giving advice for a good life (this personality trait was not retained in the dubbed version). Arbormon's primary traits are sloth and gluttony, having spent most of the series either trying to find something to eat or sleeping. However, he is fiercely loyal to his allies and his primary goal in fighting the [[DigiDestined]] was to avenge [[Grumblemon]] having his Beast Spirit lost. Arbormon was capable of Slide Evolving to Petaldramon.

Ultimately, he fought the DigiDestined on his own and was defeated, whereupon his Beast Spirit was absorbed by [[Kouji Minamoto|Lobomon]]. Immediately afterwards, [[Kouichi Kimura|Duskmon]] appeared and destroyed Arbormon, stating that, without his Beast Spirit, there was really no use for him. After his death, Arbormon's Human Spirit was absorbed by Duskmon. Later on when Koji took the Spirits of Darkness, he also took Arbormon's Spirit (though it wasn't shown clearly). Arbormon's spirits were later transferred into [[Takuya Kanbara|Takuya]]'s D-Tector so he could Hyper Spirit Evolve to EmperorGreymon.

A purified Arbormon later appeared at the Village Of Beginnings to help the other legendary warriors fight [[Crusadermon]] and [[Dynasmon]].

* '''Roundhouse Punt/Power Pummel''' (''Machinegun Dance''): His legs and arms spin while attached to ropes when he uses them to punch/kick his opponents from long distances.
