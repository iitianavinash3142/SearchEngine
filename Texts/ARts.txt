'''aRts''', which stands for '''a'''nalog '''R'''eal '''t'''ime '''s'''ynthesizer, is an audio framework that is no longer under development. It is most famous for previously being used in [[KDE]] (series [[KDE 2|2]] and [[KDE 3|3]]) to simulate an [[analog synthesizer]].

A key component of aRts is the [[sound server]] which mixes several [[streaming media|sound stream]]s in [[Real-time computing|realtime]]. The [[sound server]], called '''artsd''' (d for [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]), is also utilized as the standard sound server for KDE2–3. However, the sound server is not dependent on KDE and can be used in other projects. It is a direct competitor to [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]], another real-time sound server, and an indirect competitor to the [[Enlightened Sound Daemon]] (ESD). It is now common to use [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]]'s software mixing instead of artsd.

The '''aRts''' [[Platform (computing)|platform]] also includes aRts Builder — an [[application software|application]] for building custom layouts and configurations for audio mixers, sequencers, synthesizers and other audio [[schema]]{{dn}} via a user-friendly [[graphical user interface]]. aRts is [[free software]], distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

== End of project ==
On December 2, 2004 aRts' creator and primary developer Stefan Westerfeld announced he was leaving the project due to a variety of fundamental development and technical issues with aRts.
