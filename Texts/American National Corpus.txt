The full 22 million word ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A 15 million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website].

The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool, the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES)]] (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software.

The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and  annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation.

ANC annotations are automatically-produced and unvalidated. A '''Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus''' (MASC) will be released in Fall 2009,{{Update after|2010|11|25}} which includes validated annotations for the above-mentioned phenomena as well as [[Treebank|Penn Treebank]] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, and [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations.

In Fall, 2009, the OANC Ngram Search Engine will become available on the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website], which will provide intra- and inter-sentential pattern-based searches. In early 2010, the OANC will be expanded to include an additional 20-30 million words of written and spoken data.{{Update after|2010|11|25}}
