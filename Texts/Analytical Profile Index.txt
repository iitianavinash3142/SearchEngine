The '''Analytical Profile Index''' or '''API''' is a [[Biological classification|classification]] of [[bacteria]] based on experiments, allowing fast [[Identification (biology)|identification]]. It was invented in the 1970s in the United States by Pierre Janin of Analytab Products, Inc. [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=3936356.PN.&OS=PN/3936356&RS=PN/3936356] Presently, the API test system is manufactured by bioMeriux.[http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/servlet/srt/bio/clinical-diagnostics/dynPage?doc=CNL_PRD_CPL_G_PRD_CLN_11] The API range introduced a standardized, miniaturized version of existing techniques, which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read.

The API 20E/NE fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of [[Gram-negative]] [[Enterobacteriaceae]] or non-Enterobacteriaceae. The test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes, which include the substrates. An identification is only possible with [[microbiological culture]].
To guarantee a comparability of different samples, follow the introductions of the manufacturer.


HINT:
This system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria. Because of it, only known bacteria can be identified.
