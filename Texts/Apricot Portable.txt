'''Apricot Portable''' was [[Apricot Computers]]' attempt at a [[portable computer]], first released in 1984. It had a 3.5" [[floppy drive]], 4.77 MHz CPU and 256 KiB [[RAM]]. It was the first computer to use an 80-column/25-line [[LCD]] and [[speech recognition]] for input/output. The speech recognition software held 4096 words, with only 64 available at a given time. It was also unique in the way that it had an infrared link between it and the keyboard; this was relatively new at the time. However, if an object blocked the infrared beam, communications would be cut off. The Apricot also featured a somewhat [[Macintosh|Mac]]-like graphical interface. It was originally priced at £1965.
