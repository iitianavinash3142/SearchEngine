'''Aircrack-ng''' is a network software suite consisting of a detector, [[packet sniffer]], [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]/[[WPA2-PSK]] [[Wireless cracking|cracker and analysis]] tool for [[802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]s. It works with any [[Wireless network interface card|wireless card]] whose driver supports [[Monitor mode|raw monitoring mode]] (for a list, visit the website of the project or [http://wiki.remote-exploit.org/index.php/HCL:Wireless]) and can sniff [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] traffic. The program runs under [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]; the Linux version has been ported to the [[Sharp Zaurus|Zaurus]] and [[Maemo (operating system)|Maemo]] platforms, and a [[proof-of-concept]] port has been made to the [[iPhone]].

In April 2007 a team at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] in [[Germany]] developed a new attack method based on a paper released on the RC4 cypher by [[Adi Shamir]]. This new attack, named 'PTW', decreases the number of [[initialization vector]]s or IVs needed to decrypt a WEP key and has been included in the aircrack-ng suite since the 0.9 release.

Aircrack-ng is a fork of the original [[Aircrack]] project.

== Features ==
The aircrack-ng software suite includes:
