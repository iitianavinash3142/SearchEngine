An '''anti-moose mat''' is an electrical mat used to keep [[moose]] away from certain areas. In October 2005, the municipal airport in [[Wasilla]], [[Alaska]] installed mats around the airfield to prevent moose from walking onto the runway and colliding with aircraft. A full-grown moose can weigh up to one thousand pounds, and can create many problems at some airports.  Therefore, the anti-moose mat can be very useful.
