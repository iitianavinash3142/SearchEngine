'''Avalanche''' is a [[dynamic program analysis]] tool developed in [[Institute_for_System_Programming|ISP RAS]] that performs [[symbolic execution]] in order to generate input data that causes an analysed program to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Avalanche uses [[Instrumentation_(computer_programming)|dynamic binary instrumentation]] framework provided by [[Valgrind]] to collect a set of [[Constraint_(mathematics)|constraints]] which are then [[Constraint_satisfaction|solved]] by [http://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/ STP] [[constraint solver]].

Avalanche is [[Open-source_software|open source]].
