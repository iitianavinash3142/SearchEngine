'''Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions)''' is a fictional robot appearing in the [[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla]] of Stephen King's [[Dark Tower]] series.  He is approximately 7 feet tall, has very large data banks and dictionaries, can reproduce music, and is superhumanly strong and  near superhumanly fast.  He was made by Lamerk Industries an indeterminate number of years ago (Andy says that he may have been built more than two thousand years before).

Andy seems to enjoy talking to the people of the Calla; in fact some of the people mention that he sometimes will not shut up.  He tells horoscopes, although they seem to be in the same vein as horoscopes one might find in a newspaper.

[[Roland Deschain]] and his ka-tet encounter Andy, along with a few villagers, a few miles outside of [[Calla Bryn Sturgis]], a village that lies along the Beam (their road to the Dark Tower).  While the villagers tend to trust Andy and even thank him for telling them the bad news of the Wolves coming, Roland and his party, partly due to prior experience with [[Blaine the Mono]], tend to distrust the intent behind his words.

Andy turns out to be the primary antagonist of the book, being the agent of the Red that relays information to a [[taheen]] named Finli o'Tego in Thunderclap.  Additionally he seems to act as Ben Slightman's handler, as Ben is also reporting on events in the Calla, especially the events surrounding Roland and his ka-tet.
