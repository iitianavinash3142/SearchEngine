By September 2006, the study group has completed its charter and IEEE 802.3 formed the 802.3av task force to produce the draft standard for 10 Gbit/s EPON. In September 2009, the IEEE 802 Plenary ratified the amendment to 802.3 to make 802.3av a standard.

The following are the major milestones in 10 Gbit/s EPON study group:

== Architecture ==
=== Symmetric 10 Gb/s EPON (10/10G-EPON) ===
Symmetric-rate 10/10G-EPON supports transmit and receive data paths operating at 10 Gbit/s.  The main driver for 10/10G-EPON is the necessity to provide adequate downstream and upstream bandwidth to support the [[Multi-Dwelling Unit|MDU]] environment. When deployed in the [[Multi-Dwelling Unit|MDU]] configuration, one EPON ONU may be connected to up to a thousand subscribers. 

The 10/10G-EPON employs a number of functions that are common to other point-to-point Ethernet standards.  For example, such functions as 64B/66B line coding, self-synchronizing scrambler, or gearbox are also used in 10GBASE-SR, 10GBASE-LR, 10GBASE-ER, 10GBASE-LRM, and 10GBASE-KR types of Ethernet links.

=== Asymmetric 10 Gb/s EPON (10/1G-EPON) ===

The asymmetric 10/1G-EPON appear less challenging than the symmetric option, as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies.  The upstream transmission is identical to that of the existing 1G-EPON (as specified in IEEE Std. 802.3ah), and will rely on field-proven and mass deployed burst-mode optical transceivers. The downstream transmission, which uses continuous-mode optics, will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit/s point-to-point Ethernet devices.

=== Power budgets ===
The 802.3av defines several power budgets, denoted either PR or PRX.  PRX power budget describes asymmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 1 Gbit/s upstream.  PR power budget describes symmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 10 Gbit/s upstream.  Each power budget is further identified with a numeric representation of its class, where value of 10 represents low power budget, value of 20 represents medium power budget, and value of 30 represents high power budget.  The 802.3av draft standard defines the following power budgets:

=== Forward error correction ===

The 10G-EPON employs a ''stream-based'' forward error correction (FEC) mechanism based on Reed Solomon(255, 223). The FEC is mandatory for all channels operating at 10 Gbit/s rate, i.e., both downstream and upstream channels in symmetric 10 Gbit/s EPON and the downstream channel in the 10/1 Gbit/s asymmetric EPON. (Upstream channel in the asymmetric EPON is the same as in 1 Gbit/s EPON, i.e., optional frame-based FEC using RS(255, 239).)

== Backward compatibility ==

The 10G-EPON standard defines a new physical layer, keeping the MAC, MAC Control and all the layers above unchanged to the greatest extent possible.  This means that users of 10G-EPON can expect backward compatibility of network management system (NMS), PON-layer operations, administrations, and maintenance (OAM) system, DBA and scheduling, and so on.

=== Coexistence with 1G-EPON ===

The 802.3av standard places significant emphasis on enabling simultaneous operation of 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s EPON systems on the same outside plant. In the downstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels are separated in the wavelength domain, with 1 Gbit/s transmission limited to 1480-1500 nm band and 10 Gbit/s transmission using 1575-1580 nm band. 

In the upstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s bands overlap. 1 Gbit/s band spreads from 1260 to {{convert|1360|nmi|km|abbr=on}}; 10 Gbit/s band uses 1260 to {{convert|1280|nmi|km|abbr=on}} band.  This allows both upstream channels to share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic disperson, but requires the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels to be separated in time domain. Since burst transmissions from different ONUs now may have different line rates, this method is termed ''dual-rate TDMA''.

Various OLT implementations may support 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s transmissions only downstream direction, only upstream direction, or in both downstream and upstream directions. The following table illustrates which ONU types are simultaneously supported by various OLT implementations:

==10GPON==
[[G.987]] [[10GPON]] has 10Gbps downstream and 2.5Gps upstream – framing is ”G-PON like” and so intended to coexist with [[GPON]] instead of EPON. [http://conference.vde.com/ecoc-2009/programs/documents/sp_stefandahlfort_ng%20access.pdf]
