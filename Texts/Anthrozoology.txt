Anthrozoology is a modern [[interdisciplinary]] and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including  [[anthropology]], [[ethology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of the reality of their interactions. 

[http://www.swabe.org/faq.htm swabe.org] comments: {{quote|In reality, there is little homogeneity in anthrozoological research, certainly as far as disciplinary approach, methodology and theory is concerned. The academic backgrounds of anthrozoological researchers can be extremely varied. There are, for example, social scientists, psychologists, zoologists, ethologists, historians, philosophers, veterinarians and even physicians studying the human-animal relationship.}}

It adds that anthrozoology may veer towards ethics, behavioral research, welfare and promotion, and many other areas within the human-animal interface.

==Example areas of study==
* The [[interaction]] and enhancement within [[Captivity (animal)|captive animal]] interactions.
* Affective (emotional) or [[relational bonds between humans and animals]] (which may range from having [[companion animal]]s to [[zoophilia]])
* Human [[perception]]s and [[belief]]s in respect of other animals.
* How some animals fit into human [[society|societies]].
* How these vary between [[culture]]s, and change over times.
* The study of animal [[domestication]]: how and why [[domestic animal]]s evolved from wild species ([[paleoanthrozoology]]). 
* Captive zoo animal bonds with keepers

Examples of papers published by ISAZ as of 2005 include:
