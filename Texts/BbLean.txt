'''bbLean''' is a [[Shell (computing)|shell]] replacement for [[Microsoft Windows]].  It is a development branch of [[BB4Win]], and like that shell, it has a minimalist look.  bbLean deviates slightly from the minimalist intent of its parent by offering added functionality while retaining the basic simplicity of BB4Win.  

Despite this added functionality, the stated goal of the developers is to produce a ''lean'' shell (the name is an abbreviation for "[[Blackbox]] Lean"), one that offers more core features than the parent shell while improving shell speed and restraining system overhead.  As a result, bbLean has gained a reputation as a shell that works better than BB4Win or [[Xoblite]] on older PCs and older versions of Windows.

The shell is extensible by the myriad of plugins that exist, and some extensive mods have been created.  [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?t=2286 bbClean] is a rewrite of former mod [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?t=2108 bbLean 1.16z]; along with improvements upon 1.16z's operation, it includes several new features  (e.g. volume bars, menu icon support) and customization options (e.g. expanded transparency options and text shadows); there is a fork of bbClean called  [http://utbox.weebly.com/ utbox].  Another such mod is [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?p=11681#11681 bbLean Mod], which adds aesthetic elements such as new bullets and text shadows.

bbLean is not under active development and the forum's admins have all left. [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1263&start=15 The official forum] is dead because the shell is basically dead.
