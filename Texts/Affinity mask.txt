An '''affinity mask''' is a [[mask (computing)|bit mask]] indicating what [[Central processing unit|processor(s)]] a [[thread (computer science)|thread]] or [[process (computing)|process]] should be run on by the [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] of an [[operating system]]. Setting the affinity mask for certain processes running under Windows can be useful as there are several system processes (especially on domain controllers) that are restricted to the first CPU / Core. So, excluding the first CPU might lead to better application performance.

== Windows API ==
Thread affinity in [[Microsoft Windows]] can be specified with the ''SetThreadAffinityMask'' function. Forcing of each [[OpenMP]] thread to distinctive cores in Windows can be accomplished by means of the following [[C (programming language)|C]] code:
 // Set OpenMP thread affinity
 void set_thread_affinity () {
     #pragma omp parallel default(shared)
     {
     SetThreadAffinityMask( GetCurrentThread(), mask );
     }
 }
