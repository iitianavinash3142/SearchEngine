The '''Vortex''' audio accelerator chipset line from [[Aureal Semiconductor]] was designed to improve performance of their then-popular [[A3D]] audio technology.  The first member of the line, the Vortex AU8820, was announced on July 14, 1997[http://web.archive.org/web/19971014130227/www.aureal.com/press/071497-vortex.html], and was used in by a number of sound card manufacturers, like Yamaha and [[Turtle Beach Systems|Turtle Beach]].  After Aureal's release of A3D 2.0, the Vortex AU8830 (known as the Vortex 2) was announced on August 6, 1998[http://web.archive.org/web/19990827184623/http://aureal.com/cgi-bin/pub/display.pl?template=press_aur_detail.htm&serial=100].  The Vortex 2 chipset won numerous industry awards, and was used among other places in the [[Diamond Multimedia | Diamond]] Monster Sound MX300, which achieved near-cult status with audiophiles and gamers for the high quality of its positional audio.

Near the end of Aureal's existence, they released a Vortex Advantage budget sound card aimed at systems integrators, which ran on the Vortex AU8810 chipset[http://web.archive.org/web/19990827184623/http://aureal.com/cgi-bin/pub/display.pl?template=press_aur_detail.htm&serial=1045].
