'''A/UX''' (from '''A'''pple '''U'''ni'''x''') was [[Apple Computer]]’s implementation of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]] for some of their [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. The later versions of A/UX ran on the [[Macintosh II]], [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] series of machines as well as the [[Macintosh SE/30|SE/30]]. A/UX was first released in 1988, with the final version (3.1.1) released in 1995. A/UX required a [[68k]]-based Macintosh with an [[Floating point unit|FPU]] and a paged [[memory management unit]] (PMMU).

The operating system was based on [[UNIX System V]] Release 2.2. It included some additional features from System V Releases 3 & 4 and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] versions 4.2 & 4.3. It was [[POSIX]] and [[System V Interface Definition]] (SVID) compliant and included [[TCP/IP]] [[computer network|networking]] from version 2 onward. There were rumors of a later version using [[OSF/1]] as its primary code base, but this system was never released to the public, if it even existed. 

==Features==
A/UX 3.x provided a [[graphical user interface]] with the familiar [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] windows, menus, and controls. The A/UX Finder was not the same program as the [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] Finder, but a customized version adapted to run as a Unix [[Process (computing)|process]] and designed to interact with the Unix [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and [[file system]]s. A/UX 3.x also included a '''CommandShell''' terminal program, which offered a [[command line interface]] to the underlying Unix system, a feature which had never been available on Macintosh computers running the classic [[Mac OS]] Finder. An [[X Window System]] server application (called '''MacX''') with a terminal program could also be used to interface with the system and run X applications directly in the Finder. Alternatively, the user could choose to run a full X11R4 session without the Finder.

By including a [[compatibility layer]], A/UX could run [[Macintosh System]] 7.0.1, Unix, and "hybrid" [[Application software|application]]s. A hybrid application used both Macintosh and Unix system functions: for example, a Macintosh application which called Unix system functions, or a Unix application which called [[Macintosh Toolbox]] (e.g. [[QuickDraw]]) functions. The compatibility layer used some existing Toolbox functions in the computer’s [[Read-only memory|ROM]], while other function calls were translated into native Unix [[system call]]s.

A/UX included a utility called '''Commando''' (similar to a tool of the same name included with [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]]) to assist users with entering [[Unix commands]]. Opening a Unix [[executable]] file from the Finder would open a [[dialog box]] that allowed the user to choose [[Command line interface|command-line]] options for the program using standard controls such as [[radio button]]s and [[check box]]es, and display the resulting command line [[Parameter (computer science)|argument]] for the user before executing the command or program. This feature was intended to ease the [[Experience curve effects|learning curve]] for users new to Unix, and decrease the user’s reliance on the [[Unix manual]].

A/UX users had one central source for most A/UX applications, a [[Server (computing)|server]] at [[NASA]] called “Jagubox” administered by [[Jim Jagielski]], who was also the editor of the A/UX [[FAQ]]. Although Jagubox is down, some [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]] are still maintained. 

==Decline==

Aside from a few isolated servers still running it, A/UX is essentially extinct, and is considered to be [[abandonware]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
