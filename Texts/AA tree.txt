AA trees are a variation of the [[red-black tree]], which in turn is an enhancement to the [[binary search tree]]. Unlike red-black trees, red nodes on an AA tree can only be added as a right subchild. In other words, no red node can be a left sub-child.  This results in the simulation of a [[2-3 tree]] instead of a [[2-3-4 tree]], which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations. The maintenance algorithms for a red-black tree need to consider seven different shapes to properly balance the tree:

An AA tree on the other hand only needs to consider two shapes due to the strict requirement that only right links can be red:

== Balancing Rotations ==

Typically, AA trees are implemented with levels instead of colors, unlike red-black trees.  Each node has a level field, and the following invariants must remain true for the tree to be valid:

# The level of a leaf node is one.
# The level of a left child is strictly less than that of its parent.
# The level of a right child is less than or equal to that of its parent.
# The level of a right grandchild is strictly less than that of its grandparent.
# Every node of level greater than one must have two children.

Only two operations are needed for maintaining balance in an AA tree. These operations are called skew and split. Skew is a right rotation when an insertion or deletion creates a left horizontal{{Clarify|What's a ''horizontal link''?|date=July 2010}} link, which can be thought of as a left red link in the red-black tree context. Split is a conditional left rotation when an insertion or deletion creates two horizontal right links, which once again corresponds to two consecutive red links in red-black trees.

== Insertion ==

Insertion begins with the normal binary tree search and insertion procedure.  Then, as the call stack unwinds (assuming a recursive implementation of the search), it's easy to check the validity of the tree and perform any rotations as necessary.  If a horizontal left link arises, a skew will be performed, and if two horizontal right links arise, a split will be performed, possibly incrementing the level of the new root node of the current subtree.  Note, in the code as given above, the increment of level(T).  This makes it necessary to continue checking the validity of the tree as the modifications bubble up from the leaves.

 '''function''' insert '''is'''
     '''input:''' X, the value to be inserted, and T, the root of the tree to insert it into.
     '''output:''' A balanced version T including X.
 
     ''Do the normal binary tree insertion procedure.  Set the result of the''
     ''recursive call to the correct child in case a new node was created or the''
     ''root of the subtree changes.''
     '''if''' nil(T) '''then'''
         ''Create a new leaf node with X.''
         '''return''' node(X, 1, Nil, Nil)
         left(T) := insert(X, left(T))
     '''else if''' X > value(T) '''then'''
         right(T) := insert(X, right(T))
     '''end if'''
     ''Note that the case of X == value(T) is unspecified.  As given, an insert
     will have no effect.  The implementor may desire different behavior.''
 
     ''Perform skew and then split.  The conditionals that determine whether or
     not a rotation will occur or not are inside of the procedures, as given
     above.''
     T := skew(T)
     T := split(T)
 
     '''return T'''
 '''end function'''

== Deletion ==

As in most balanced binary trees, the deletion of an internal node can be turned into the deletion of a leaf node by swapping the internal node with either its closest predecessor or successor, depending on which are in the tree or on the implementor's whims.  Retrieving a predecessor is simply a matter of following one left link and then all of the remaining right links.  Similarly, the successor can be found by going right once and left until a null pointer is found.  Because of the AA property of all nodes of level greater than one having two children, the successor or predecessor node will be in level 1, making their removal trivial.

To re-balance a tree, there are a few approaches.  The one described by Andersson in his [http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/abs/simp.html original paper] is the simplest, and it is described here, although actual implementations may opt for a more optimized approach.  After a removal, the first step to maintaining tree validity is to lower the level of any nodes whose children are two levels below them, or who are missing children.  Then, the entire level must be skewed and split.  This approach was favored, because when laid down conceptually, it has three easily understood separate steps:

# Decrease the level, if appropriate.
# Skew the level.
# Split the level.

However, we have to skew and split the entire level this time instead of just a node, complicating our code.

 '''function''' delete '''is'''
     '''input:''' X, the value to delete, and T, the root of the tree from which it should be deleted.
     '''output:''' T, balanced, without the value X.
 
     '''if''' X > value(T) '''then'''
         right(T) := delete(X, right(T))
         left(T) := delete(X, left(T))
     '''else'''
         ''If we're a leaf, easy, otherwise reduce to leaf case.'' 
         '''if''' leaf(T) '''then'''
             return Nil
         '''else if''' nil(left(T)) '''then'''
             L := successor(T)
             right(T) := delete(L, right(T))
             value(T) := L
         '''else'''
             L := predecessor(T)
             left(T) := delete(L, left(T))
             value(T) := L
         '''end if'''
     '''end if'''
 
     ''Rebalance the tree.  Decrease the level of all nodes in this level if
     necessary, and then skew and split all nodes in the new level.''
     T := decrease_level(T)
     T := skew(T)
     right(T) := skew(right(T))
     right(right(T)) := skew(right(right(T)))
     T := split(T)
     right(T) := split(right(T))
     return T
 '''end function'''

 '''function''' decrease_level '''is'''
     '''input:''' T, a tree for which we want to remove links that skip levels.
     '''output:''' T with its level decreased.
 
     should_be = min(level(left(T)), level(right(T))) + 1
         level(T) := should_be
             level(right(T)) := should_be
         '''end if'''
     '''end if'''
     return T
 '''end function'''

A good example of deletion by this algorithm is present in the [http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/abs/simp.html Andersson paper].

== Performance ==

The performance of an AA tree is equivalent to the performance of a red-black tree. While an AA tree makes more rotations than a red-black tree, the simpler algorithms tend to be faster, and all of this balances out to result in similar performance. A red-black tree is more consistent in its performance than an AA tree, but an AA tree tends to be flatter, which results in slightly faster search times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
