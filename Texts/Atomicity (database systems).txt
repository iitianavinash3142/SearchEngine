{{Other uses|Atomicity (disambiguation)}}

In [[database system]]s, '''atomicity''' (or '''atomicness''') is one of the [[ACID]] [[database transaction|transaction]] properties. In an '''atomic transaction''', a series of database operations either ''all'' occur, or ''nothing'' occurs. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright.

The etymology of the phrase originates in the Classical Greek concept of a fundamental and indivisible component; see [[atom]].

An example of atomicity is ordering an airline ticket where two actions are required: payment, and a seat reservation. The potential passenger must either: 
# both pay for and reserve a seat; OR 
# neither pay for nor reserve a seat.
The booking system does not consider it acceptable for a customer to pay for a ticket without securing the seat, nor to reserve the seat without payment succeeding.

==Orthogonality==
Atomicity does not behave completely [[Orthogonality#Computer science|orthogonally]] with regard to the other [[ACID]] properties of the transactions. For example, [[isolation (computer science)|isolation]] relies on atomicity to roll back changes in the event of isolation failures such as [[deadlock]]; [[database consistency|consistency]] also relies on rollback in the event of a consistency-violation by an illegal transaction. Finally, atomicity itself relies on [[durability (computer science)|durability]] to ensure the atomicity of transactions even in the face of external failures.

As a result of this, failure to detect errors and manually roll back the enclosing transaction may cause failures of isolation and consistency.

==Implementation==
Typically, systems implement atomicity by providing some mechanism to indicate which transactions have started and which finished; or by keeping a copy of the data before any changes occurred.  Several filesystems have developed methods for avoiding the need to keep multiple copies of data, using journaling (see [[journaling file system]]). Databases usually implement this using some form of logging/journaling to track changes. The system synchronizes the logs (often the [[metadata]]) as necessary once the actual changes have successfully taken place. Afterwards, crash recovery simply ignores incomplete entries. Although implementations vary depending on factors such as concurrency issues, the principle of atomicity — i.e. complete success or complete failure — remain.

Ultimately, any application-level implementation relies on [[operating system|operating-system]] functionality, which in turn makes use of specialized hardware to guarantee that an operation remains non-interruptible: either by software attempting to re-divert system resources (see [[pre-emptive multitasking]]) or by resource-unavailability (such as power-outages).  For example, [[POSIX]]-compliant systems provide the open(2) [[system call]] which allows applications to atomically open a file. Other popular system-calls that may assist in achieving atomic operations from [[userspace]] include mkdir(2), flock(2), fcntl(2), rasctl(2) (NetBSD re-startable sequences), semop(2), sem_wait(2), sem_post(2), fdatasync(2), fsync(2) and rename(2).

The hardware level requires [[linearizability|atomic operations]] such as [[test-and-set]] (TAS), and/or atomic increment/decrement operations. In their absence, or when necessary, raising the interrupt level to disable all possible interrupts (of hardware and software origin) may serve to implement the atomic synchronization function [[language primitive|primitives]]. Systems often implement these low-level operations  in [[machine language]] or in [[assembly language]].
