==RECON-IV ROUV==
The origin of 8A4 traces back to the RECON-IV ROUV.  Since the 1980s, China begun to operate ROUVs to support its offshore oil drill operations and salvage operations, such as Hysub 10 ROUVs and Hysub 40 ROUVs supplied by the Canadian firm International Submarine Engineering in [[British Columbia]].  Hysub 40 ROUVs was deployed by [[Shanghai]] Salvage Bureau and proved its worth not only in oil drilling operations, but also in salvage and rescue missions.  However, these foreign built ROUVs were simply too expensive to be adopted in significant numbers, and the salvage operational needs of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN) could not be met.  As a result, China decided to develop its own version of ROUVs with similar capability.

One of the first ROUVs domestically built in China was the RECON-IV ROUV, which is based on the American RECON-III ROUV built by Perry Oceanographic (later purchased by [[Lockheed Martin]]) based in [[Riviera Beach, Florida]].  Based on the technology transfer, the [[Shenyang Institute of Automation]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Science]] and Perry Oceanographic jointly developed the RECON-IV ROUV, which was adopted by People's Liberation Army Navy for salvage and rescue operations.  However, like earlier ROUVs, the RECON-IV is primarily designed for civilian operations and had its limitations in performing certain military operations, such as cutting through specialized steel used to build certain compartments of submarines that were stranded, and opening some valves on sinking vessels, thus a more capable follow-up was needed.

==8A4 ROUV==
To develop a ROUV that meets the special needs of military salvage and rescue operations that was not commercially available on the market, China organized a design team in the late 1980s including the 702nd Research Institute of [[China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation]] (CSIC), the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of [[Harbin Engineering University]] (HEU), and the Institute of Underwater Engineering of [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] (SHJTU), with a professor of SHJTU, Mr. Xu Huangnan (徐芑南), and the future deputy general designer of [[Explorer AUV]], and the future general designer of other Chinese unmanned underwater vehicles including [[Sea Dragon class ROUV]], [[CR class AUV]], and [[SJT class ROUV]], was named as the general designer of the 8A4 ROUV.  The goal was to develop an ROUV primarily used for military applications, while also capable of performing civilian tasks as the secondary mission.


The first 8A4 ROUV completed sea trials in 1993 and subsequently entered service.  During its evaluation, the 8A4 ROUV successfully opened a submarine compartment constructed of special steel, a feat no other ROUV in Chinese inventory could achieve, and the 8A4 was thus dubbed as the most capable salvage and rescue ROUV in Chinese service. The 8A4 is capable of operating at a depth of up to 600 meters, with a cruising radius of up to 150 meters, and it was one of the first ROUVs in Chinese inventory to incorporate a Tether Management System (TMS).  In 1996, the 8A4 ROUV won 3rd Place in the Scientific and Technological Advancement Award of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation.  Despite the success and awards received, the 8A4 class ROUV is severely limited in its capability during actual deployment due to financial constraints. With the exception of the very first unit, all of the remaining 8A4 ROUVs have their TMS deleted due to the budget cuts, resulting in significant reduction in performance.  For example, the maximum operational depth is reduced by more than half. It is not until the early 2010s during the scheduled overhaul would the TMS be planned to be reintroduced to all the 8A4 ROUVs to achieve their full capability.

==7B8 ROUV==
The 7B8 ROUV is a further development of the 8A4 ROUV, and it is a Chinese transition from ROUV to [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV).  Designed by the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of [[Harbin Engineering University]] (HEU) based on the experience of the 8A4 ROUV with Mr. Deng Sanrui (邓三瑞) as the general designer, the 7B8 ROUV was first revealed to the Chinese public in [[Beijing]] during the National Science and Technology Exhibition of the [[People's Liberation Army]] at the [[Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution]] in 1995 while still under development, and members of the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] headed by General [[Liu Huaqing]] was among those special guests.

The 7B8 ROUV is unique in that in comparison to other Chinese ROUVs, it can also operate independently as an AUV in addition to being operated remotely via tether/cable like ordinary ROUVs. The 7B8 first completed its trials as an ROUV in the 1990s and in 2000. Then it completed AUV trials including autonomously searching underwater targets and autonomous underwater work, and subsequently entered service.  When the 7B8 is operated as an AUV, the maximum operating depth is less than when operating as an ROUV.

Specifications:
* Length: 4.33 meters
* Width: 1.27 meters
* Height: 1.76 meters
* Weight: 1.69 tons
* Operating depth: 100 meters (when operating as an [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|AUV]])
