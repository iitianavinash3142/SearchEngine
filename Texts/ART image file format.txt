The AOL service can automatically convert images [[downloading|downloaded]] from the [[Internet]] to the compressed ART format. This conversion, which can be turned off, reduces download time for the image file. Image display problems with the AOL [[web browser]] are addressed at [http://web.archive.org/web/20071026143856/http://webmaster.info.aol.com/faq.html#graphics America Online webmaster FAQ entry]. An art file opened with AOL picture viewer can be saved as another file type. 

ART files can be batch converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPG]], and other file formats with rare graphics programs, such as Graphic Workshop Professional [http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gwspro.html] with an .art plug-in. Old versions of Internet Explorer can open and convert ART files to [[BMP file format|BMP]] files, through the File/[[Save As]] command.
