'''Automator''' is an application developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for [[Mac OS X]] that implements point-and-click (or drag-and-drop) creation of [[workflow]]s for automating repetitive tasks into [[Batch processing|batch]]es for quicker alteration, thus saving time and effort over human intervention to manually change each file separately. Automator enables the repetition of tasks across a wide variety of programs, including the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]], the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, [[iCal]], [[Address Book]] and others. It can also work with third-party applications such as [[Microsoft Office]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] or [[Pixelmator]]. Automator was first released with [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4).

== Interface ==
Automator provides a [[GUI|graphical user interface]] for automating tasks without knowledge of programming or scripting languages. Tasks can be recorded as they are performed by the user or can be selected from a list. The output of the last action can become the input to the next.

== Features ==
Automator comes with a library of Actions (file renaming, finding linked images, creating a new mail message, etc.) that act as individual steps in a Workflow document. A Workflow document is used to carry out repetitive tasks. Workflows can be saved and reused. [[Unix]] command line scripts and AppleScripts can also be invoked as Actions. The actions are linked together in a Workflow. The Workflow can be saved as an application, Workflow file or a [[contextual menu]] item. Options can be set when the Workflow is created or when the Workflow is run.

== Examples ==
Example workflows are available [http://automator.us/examples.html here].
