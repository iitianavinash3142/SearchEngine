In [[cryptography]], '''ARIA''' is a [[block cipher]] designed in 2003 by a large group of [[South Korea]]n researchers. In 2004, the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]] selected it as a standard cryptographic technique.

The algorithm uses a [[substitution-permutation network]] structure based on [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]. The interface is the same as AES: 128-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] with [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is 12, 14, or 16, depending on the key size. ARIA uses two 8&times;8-bit [[substitution box|S-boxes]] and their inverses in alternate rounds; one of these is the [[Rijndael S-box]].

The [[key schedule]] processes the [[key (cryptography)|key]] using a 3-round 256-bit [[Feistel cipher]], with the binary expansion of 1/[[pi|''π'']] as a source of "[[nothing up my sleeve number]]s".
