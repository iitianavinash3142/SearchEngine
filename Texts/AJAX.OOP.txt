'''AJAX.OOP''' is an [[open source]] [[JavaScript]] framework distributed under [[MIT License]]. Providing with [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]]-style coding engine and [[AJAX]] requests handling functionality to create [[web2.0]] components. Due to OOP paradigm AJAX.OOP library can be easily extended with additional functionality or used as core for other projects.

==The JavaScript OOP Library==

AJAX.OOP is a fast and scalable JavaScript Library for creating JavaScript/AJAX components in an object oriented way.

Main feature - strong [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]] paradigm implementation.AJAX.OOP engine allows the programmer to:

* Create classes with object-like defining syntax
* Inherit classes (both AJAX.OOP-style defined and created with native JavaScript code)
* Aggregate classes (including aggregation of self and parent class with special operators this.$_self and this.$_super)
* Define constructors as they are (name = 'constructor')
* Override parent class properties and methods (but call parent if you need by using special access operator this.$super)
* Access/call any parent properties and/or methods from any method of child class (just use this.$super accessor whenever you need to access parent properties and methods)
* Use strict defined objects with workable 'instanceof' operator on them when instantiating an exemplar of AJAX.OOP classes
