== History ==
The AMT system was developed by [[Patrick Soquet]], a developer in [[Belgium]] working for [[Arborescence]] a French company that was later acquired by [[Euro RSCG|Havas]]. From 1993 onwards it was marketed by Apple but all development was done by the independent team led by M. Soquet. In 1996 development of the tool was taken over by Apple and the 2.1 version of the program was developed in house by a team of engineers in [[California]] led by [[Dan Crow (computer scientist)|Dan Crow]]. In 1997 Apple decided to concentrate its multimedia offerings on [[QuickTime]] and [[HyperCard]] and the rights to AMT returned to Havas. Patrick Soquet acquired these rights and co-founded [[Tribeworks iShell|Tribeworks]] and developed a new tool based on AML, called [[iShell]].

== Features ==
The major features of the Apple Media Tool were a graphical authoring tool (AMT itself) and an associated programming environment - the '''Apple Media Tool Programming Environment''' (AMTPE) which was a compiler and debugger for the underlying '''Apple Media Language''' (AML - also known as the '''Key''' language). AMT was notable as one of the first authoring systems to support embedding Apple's pioneering [[QTVR]] movie format.

AML is an [[object-oriented]] [[programming language]] based on [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] but specialized for multimedia programming. Although the AMT did not require any programming experience to use, it produced complete AML programs which were then compiled into [[byte code]] and interpreted by a runtime interpreter. The AMPTE could be used to enhance the AML code to create more complex programs, for example accessing a database to retrieve media. AML is conceptually similar to Java, with a "write once, run anywhere" approach to cross-platform development: it had runtime interpreters for both the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms.
