''AutoShade'' was an early 3D rendering package for use with [[AutoCAD]]. [[Autodesk]] developed Autoshade in 1987.

==Description==
AutoShade was an [[MS DOS]] application. Autodesk developed it to produce realistic [[Flat shading|shaded]] renderings of 3D face objects made by their [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] program, AutoCAD.  It simulated various types of lights&mdash;spot, point, and infinite directional.  To create a rendering, a person:
* Made an AutoCAD Drawing file containing 3D faces
* Placed AutoShade light and camera blocks
* Used an AutoShade-provided [[AutoLISP]] application  to export 3D faces, camera blocks, and lighting blocks to a ''scene'' file
* Opened the scene file in AutoShade and rendered the image

==Files==
AutoShade wrote the rendering to an .RND file. In the first version, the .RND file was a 2D [[Vector graphics|vector]] file, importable into applications such as [[Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator version 4]].  Later, when Autodesk added [[Gouraud shading]], the .RND could also be a [[Raster graphics|raster]] file.

Autodesk developed an application called Flimaker for MS/DOS, which converted .RND files into a format usable in [[Autodesk Animator]].  This could be used, in conjunction with [[AutoFlix]], to create rudimentary 3D animations from AutoCAD source material.

==Demise==
Though the final version of AutoShade supported [[RenderMan]] extensions, Autodesk never developed it into a full rendering application.  Even with AutoFlix, it did not support keyframing or hierarchical kinematics. When [[Autodesk]] released [[3D Studio Max|3D Studio]], the need for AutoShade ended, since 3D Studio was far superior in technology and in ease of use.
