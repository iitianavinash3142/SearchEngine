The existence of many different audio and video standards necessitates the definition of hardware interfaces, which define the physical characteristics of the connections between electrical equipment. This includes the types and numbers of wires required along with the strength and frequency of the signal. It also includes the physical design of the plugs and sockets.

An interface may define a connector that is used only by that interface (e.g., [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]]) or may define a connector that is also used by another interface; for example, [[RCA Jack|RCA]] connectors are defined both by the [[composite video]] and [[component video]] interfaces.

=== PC System Design Guide Audio ===

The [[PC System Design Guide]] (also known as the PC 97, PC 98, PC 99, or PC 2001 specification) is a series of hardware design requirements and recommendations for IBM PC compatible personal computers, compiled by Microsoft and Intel Corporation during 1997–2001.

PC 99 introduced a color code for the various standard types of plugs and connectors used on PCs.

===  S/PDIF ===
The electrical coaxial cable (with [[RCA Jack|RCA jacks]]) or optical fibre ([[TOSLINK]]).

Note that there are no differences in the signals transmitted over optical or coaxial [[S/PDIF]] connectors—both carry exactly the same information. Selection of one over the other rests mainly on the availability of appropriate connectors on the chosen equipment and the preference and convenience of the user. Connections longer than 6 meters or so, or those requiring tight bends, should use coaxial cable, since the high light signal attenuation of [[TOSLINK]] cables limits its effective range.

==  Connectors ==
===  Audio Connectors ===
==== TRS ====

[[Image:Photo-audiojacks.jpg|thumb|left|150px|2.5 mm (3/32") mono (TS), 3.5 mm (1/8") mono and stereo (TRS), and 6.3 mm (1/4") stereo (TRS) jack plugs]]

A [[Tip ring sleeve|TRS]] connector (tip, ring, sleeve) also called an audio jack, phone plug, jack plug, stereo plug, mini-jack, or mini-stereo.

Note: In the USA, the connectors illustrated are never called "jacks", but in other languages and countries they might well be, apparently using "jack" as a short form of "jack plug". The sockets that these plugs mate with are called "jacks" in the USA.

For special applications, plugs with two ring contacts have been made in both 3.5 mm and 6.3 mm sizes.


==== DIN ====

[[Image:5pin180dinplug.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Five-pin male 180° DIN connector]]

A [[DIN connector]] is a connector that was originally standardized by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN).


==== BNC ====

[[Image:BNC connector.jpg|thumb|left|Male 50 ohm BNC connector]]

The [[BNC connector|BNC]] (Bayonet Neill Concelman) connector is a very common type of RF connector used for terminating coaxial cable.


==== TOSLINK ====

[[Image:TOS LINK clear cable.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Clear TOSLINK cable with a round connector]]

[[TOSLINK]] or Optical Cable is a standardized optical fiber connection system. 


==== XLR ====

[[Image:Xlr-connectors.jpg|thumb|left|XLR3 cable connectors, female on left and male on right]]

The [[XLR connector]] is an electrical connector design. XLR plugs and sockets are used mostly in professional audio and video electronics cabling applications.


=== Video Connectors ===
==== Mini DIN ====

[[Image:SVideoConnector.jpg|thumb|left|mini-DIN 4 pin for [[S-Video]]]]

The [[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]] connectors are a family of multi-pin electrical connectors used in a variety of applications. [[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]] is similar to the larger, older [[DIN connector]]. Both are standards of the Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German standards body.


==== D-subminiature ====

[[Image:DSubminiatures.svg|thumb|left|150px|DA, DB, DC, DD, and DE sized connectors]]

[[D-subminiature]] or D-sub is a common type of electrical connector used particularly in computers. Calling them "subminiature" was appropriate when they were first introduced, but today they are among the largest common connectors used in computers.


==== Video In Video Out ====

[[Image:Vivo card.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A graphics card with VGA, VIVO and DVI outputs]]


[[Video In Video Out]], usually seen as the acronym '''VIVO''' (commonly pronounced vee-voh), is a [[Computer port (hardware)|graphics card port]] which enables some [[video card]]s to have [[bidirectional]] (input and output) video transfer through a [[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]], usually of the 9-pin variety, and a specialised splitter cable (which can sometimes also transfer sound).

VIVO is found predominantly on high-end [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] video cards, although a few high-end [[NVIDIA]] video cards also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports [[Composite Video|Composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[Component video|Component]] as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement [[Video Graphics Array]] or [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable.


====  DVI Connector ====

[[Image:DVI Connector Types.svg|thumb|181px|left|Male DVI connector pins (view of plug)]]
[[Image:DVI Connector M1-DA.png|thumb|181px|left|Male M1-DA connector pins (view of plug)]]

The [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) is a video interface standard designed to maximize the visual quality of digital display devices such as flat panel LCD computer displays and digital projectors. It is designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data to a display. 

There are four basic connectors:
    '''DVI-D''' (digital only)
    '''DVI-A''' (analog only)
    '''DVI-I''' (integrated, digital & analog)
    '''M1-DA''' (integrated, digital, analog & USB)

The connector also includes provision for a second data link for high resolution displays, though many devices do not implement this. In those that do, the connector is sometimes referred to as '''DVI-DL''' (dual link).

So we need to know two things about the connector: 


=== Audio and Video Connectors ===
==== RCA Jack ====

[[Image:Composite-cables.jpg|thumb|left|RCA Plugs for [[composite video]] (yellow) and [[Stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] (white and red)]]

An [[RCA jack]], also referred to as a phono connector or Cinch connector. These were first used inside pre-World-War-II radio-phonographs to connect the turntable pickup to the radio chassis. They were not intended to be disconnected and reconnected frequently, and their retaining friction was quite sufficient for their original purpose. Furthermore, the design of both cable and chassis connectors was for minimum cost.


==== HDMI ====

[[Image:HDMI.socket.png|thumb|left|HDMI Type A socket]]

[[High-Definition Multimedia Interface]] (HDMI) is a compact audio/video standard for transmitting uncompressed digital data.

There are three HDMI connector types. Type A and Type B were defined by the HDMI 1.0 specification. Type C was defined by the HDMI 1.3 specification.

Type A is electrically compatible with single link DVI-D. Type B is electrically compatible with [[Digital_Visual_Interface#Connector|dual link DVI-D]] but has not yet been used in any products.


==== Display Port ====

[[Image:DisplayPort Connector.svg|left|200px|pinout_caption=External connector (source-side) on PCB]]

[[DisplayPort]] is a digital display interface standard (approved May 2006, current version 1.1a approved on January 11, 2008). It defines a new license-free, royalty-free, digital audio/video interconnect, intended to be used primarily between a computer and its display monitor, or a computer and a home-theater system.

The video signal is not compatible with [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]], but a DisplayPort connector can pass these signals through. DisplayPort is a competitor to the HDMI connector, the [[de facto]] digital connection for high-definition consumer electronics devices.


====IEEE 1394 "FireWire"====
