== History ==

In April 2009[citation needed], Attributor and more than 1,000 publishing companies founded the Fair Syndication Consortium, the goal of which is to establish a new model for online content syndication.

Guardian was discussed by Randall Stross from the New York Times when he reported citation needed] that Attributor’s search for e-book copies of “The Lost Symbol” verified that 166 copies of the e-book were available on 11 sites. RapidShare accounted for 102.

In December 2009[citation needed], Attributor and the Fair Syndication Consortium released research data on the proliferation of U.S. newspaper content, which found that throughout a 30-day period, more than 75,000 unlicensed sites reused U.S. newspaper content online. According to the study, on these sites, 112,000 near-exact copies of unlicensed articles were detected.

In January 2010, Attributor released a research report on online book piracy [citation needed], indicating that publishers could be losing out on as much as $3 billion to online book piracy. Attributor’s FairShare Guardian service monitored 913 books in 14 subjects in the final quarter of 2009 and estimated that more than 9 million copies of books were illegally downloaded from the 25 sites it tracked. 

In April 2010, Attributor reported on online magazine infringement[citation needed]. The research looked at a segment of the magazine industry: 133 English language magazine titles, and the infringement that occurs on just 20 of the more than 2,000 domains that illegally host full-issue downloads of these magazines. Among the results, Attributor found 3,996 instances of downloadable, full issues of these 133 magazines on these 20 sites, and 84 of the 133 (63%) magazines had infringements. 

Following the magazine report, Attributor produced an Ad Server Report[citation needed] in May 2010 that analyzed those that monetize content across 270 million domains, which is nearly 75% more domains and pages covered than in previous studies. Most notably, Google and DoubleClick overwhelmingly dominated the market, combining for more than 65% of the market share, which compared to the December 2008 report, is an increase of about 9%.
