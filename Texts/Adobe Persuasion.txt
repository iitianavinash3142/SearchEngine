'''Adobe Persuasion''' (formerly '''Aldus Persuasion''') was a [[presentation program]] developed for the [[Macintosh]] [[platform (computing)|platform]] by [[Aldus Corporation]].  After it was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in 1994, when the two companies merged, a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released.  Adobe discontinued production from September 1997.

A key feature of Persuasion, which distinguished it from [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] at the time, was the use of an outline to represent the text content of the slides, which was immediately reflected on the slides (and vice versa). PowerPoint eventually copied this feature.
