The A2S API allows clients to search or browse [[Amazon.com]]'s product catalog; to retrieve detailed product information, reviews, and images; and to interface with customer shopping carts.

Amazon.com developed A2S toward three classifications of users:
* '''[[Amazon Affiliates|Associates]]''': third-party site owners wishing to build more effective sponsored [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate]] links to Amazon products, thus increasing their referral fees
* '''Vendors''': sellers on the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] platform looking to manage inventory and receive batch product data feeds
* '''Developers''': third-party developers building [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]-driven functionality into their applications
