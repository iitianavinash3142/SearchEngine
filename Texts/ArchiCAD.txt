'''ArchiCAD''' is an architectural [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software for [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] developed by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] company [[Graphisoft]]. The newest version (2010) is ArchiCAD 14. ArchiCAD offers specialized solutions for handling all common aspects of aesthetics and engineering during the whole design process of the built environment — buildings, interiors urban areas, etc.


== Product overview ==

ArchiCAD is a complete design suite with 2D and 3D drafting, visualization and other functions for architects, designers and planners. A wide range of software applications are integrated in ArchiCAD to cover most of the design needs of an architectural office:
* 2D [[CAD]] software — drawing tools for creating accurate and detailed technical drawings
* [[3D Modeling]] software — a 3D CAD interface specially developed for architects capable of creating various kind of building forms
* [[Architectural rendering]] and Visualization software — a high performance rendering tool to produce photorealistic pictures or videos
* [[Desktop publishing]] software — with similar features to mainstream DTP software to compose printed materials using technical drawings pixel-based images and texts
* [[Document management]] tool — a central data storage server with remote access, versioning tool with backup and restore features
* [[Building Information Modeling]] software — not just a collection of the above mentioned applications with an integrated user interface but a novel approach to building design called BIM

== Versions and license types ==

=== Supported platforms ===

ArchiCAD is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems. ArchiCAD 14 runs on Windows® XP Professional (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows® Vista Business and Ultimate Edition (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows® 7 (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac OS X 10.5, Mac OS X 10.6.

=== License types === 

Commercial, Educational and Full functional 30-day trial versions can be installed with the same installer. The license type is to be chosen upon installation. The installers and the necessary educational or trial registration numbers can be obtained on [https://www.myarchicad.com MyarchiCAD.com] after registration. 

* Commercial version is protected by hardware protection key. If no key is present ArchiCAD switches to Demo mode where Save, Copy, TeamWork features are disabled (printing/plotting is still enabled). 

* Educational versions are protected by registration numbers. Format files in educational version ArchiCAD are compatible with commercial ArchiCAD versions, but carry a watermark identifying the license type. Once a project has been edited with an Educational version the watermark will persist in the file.

* Trial version is a 30-day fully functional version in which you can save, print and publish projects. File formats are fully compatible with the commercial version once the copy of ArchiCAD has been converted to a commercial license. The trial version is protected by registration numbers.

=== Languages and localizations ===

ArchiCAD is available in a number of localized versions. In addition to a translated user interface and documentation, these versions have a set of parametric objects (object libraries) developed taken into consideration the specific requirements of the regional market, and different default values for object properties, menu arrangements, etc.

== Features ==

=== Working with parametric objects ===

ArchiCAD allows the user to work with data-enhanced parametric objects, often called "smart objects" by users. This differs from the operational style of other CAD programs created in the 1980s. The product allows the user to create a "virtual building" with virtual structural elements like walls, slabs, roofs, doors, windows and furniture. A large variety of pre-designed, [[ArchiCAD library part|customizable objects]] come with the program. 

ArchiCAD allows the user to work with either a 2D or 3D representation on the screen. Two-dimensional drawings can be exported at any time, even though the model in the program's database always stores data in three dimensions. Plans, elevations, and sections are generated from the three dimensional virtual building model and are constantly updated if the user 'rebuilds' the view.  Detail drawings are based on enlarged portions of the model, with 2D detail added in.

=== Collaboration and remote access ===

ArchiCAD released its first file exchange based Teamwork solution in its version 5.1 in 1997 which allowed more architects to work on the same building model simultaneously. A completely rewritten Teamwork "2.0" solution with a new database approach came out in version 13 in 2009 named Graphisoft BIM Server. Since only the changes and differences are sent to the central storage this solution allows remote access to the same project over the internet thus allowing worldwide project collaboration and coordination. 

=== APIs and scripting ===

Third-party vendors and some manufacturers of architectural products have compiled libraries of architectural components for use in ArchiCAD. The program includes Geometric Description Language ([[Geometric Description Language|GDL]]) used to create new components. Also API (Application Programming Interface) and ODBC database connections are supported), for third party Add-On developers. Via direct API links to 4D and 5D software such as Vico Office Suite or Tocoman iLink, ArchiCAD model can be exported to BIM-based cost estimation and scheduling. ArchiCAD is also directly linked via API to Solibri's Model checking and quality assurance tools.

=== Data interchange ===

ArchiCAD can import and export [[.dwg|DWG]], [[DXF]] and [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] files among others. Graphisoft is an active member of the International Alliance for Interoperability (IA), an industry organization that publishes standards for file and data interoperability for architectural CAD.

== Extensions ==

Various free and commercial add-on products and extensions add extra functionality to ArchiCAD or provide further data exchange possibilities with other software applications. Some of these extensions are developed by [[Graphisoft]], such as the freely available [[Google SketchUp]], [[Google Earth]] or [[Cinema 4D]] import/export add-ons or other extensions sold separately such as [[Graphisoft MEP Modeler]], [[Graphisoft EcoDesigner]] or Graphisoft [[Virtual Building Explorer]]; while there are a number of add-ons provided by third party vendors, such as [[Cigraph]] or [[Cadimage]].
