Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the

One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.

==History==
===Typewriter art===

In the 1954 short film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', typewriter art was a feature of the plot.

===TTY and RTTY===
TTY stands for "TeleTYpe" or "TeleTYpewriter" and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or Teletype.

===ASCII art===
[[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [[bulletin board systems]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.

During the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art.  Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for "Multi-User Dungeon", (which are textual [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[Computer role-playing game|roleplaying games]]), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[fixed-width]].


==Uses==
[[Image:ASCII Panzer unt Sattelzug.png|right|thumb|A self-propelled gun and truck made using ASCII art]]
ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teletype]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, [[printer separator]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art &mdash; for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.


"0verkill" is a 2D platform multiplayer shooter game designed entirely in colour ASCII art. [[MPlayer]] and [[VLC media player]] can display videos as ASCII art. ASCII art is used in the making of DOS-based [[ZZT]] games.

== Types and styles ==
Different techniques could be used in ASCII art to obtain different artistic effects:

 .--.     /\
 '--'    /__\    (^..^)~

- Line art, for creating shapes

 .g@8g.  db
 'Y8@P' d88b
- Solid art, for creating filled shapes

 :$#$: "4b. ':.
 :$#$:   "4b. ':.

- Shading, using different symbol density and shading for creating gradients or contrasts

   |\_/|        ****************************
  / @ @ \       *  "Purrrfectly pleasant"  *
  `»»x««´       *       (pprinz@...)       *
  /  O  \       ****************************

- combinations used as SIG (signature) at the end of an email

=== Emoticons and verticons ===
{{Main|Emoticon}}
The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text.  They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or '[[smiley]]'.

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#East Asian style|kaomoji]] (literally "face characters".) Traditionally, they are referred to as "ASCII face ".

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

===Styles of the computer underground text art scene===
====Atari 400/800 ATASCII====

====C-64 PETSCII====
The [[Commodore 64]], which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII|ASCII-1963]]. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.

===="Block ASCII" / "High ASCII" style ASCII art on the IBM PC====
[[Image:ASCII notepad acidview compare.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Block ASCII display via Notepad versus ACiDView for Windows]]



Microsoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#.22Block.22 ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.

===="Amiga"/"Oldskool" style ASCII art====
[[Image:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]]

The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, 7 years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal. This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style "Oldskool". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.

The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called "ASCII collections" and not "art packs" like on the IBM PC.

| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \ __|
|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ 
|_|   |___\____|_|\___|\__|
This kind of ASCII art is hand made in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[CygnusEd]]itor aka CED ([[Amiga]]) and [[EditPlus|EditPlus2]] ([[Wintel|PC]]).


====Newskool style ASCII art====
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]]

Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for "fine tuning" and "tweaking". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].

==Methods for generating ASCII art==
{{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}

While some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard.

The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as TheDraw and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.

===Image to text conversion===
{{Main|ASCII art converters}}

Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.

Examples of converted images are given below.

This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s [[minicomputer]]s and [[teletype]]s. During the 1970s it was popular in [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.

Since the appearance of the first simple converter tools, individuals have converted images to ASCII art automatically and afterwards claimed that they generated the result themselves "by hand" via a text editor.

Images that were converted to text, where no touch up work was done after the conversion, can in almost every case be identified as such, at least by an experienced text artist. The detection of converted, software-generated text art becomes much more difficult if some time was spent by the editor to touch up the details that are typical indicators of auto-generation.  The inconsistencies in "shading" in just one art piece are often what gives the software-created status away.

|}

Still images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various Linux and UNIX computers using the [http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib aalib (black and white)] or [http://sam.zoy.org/libcaca libcaca (colour)] graphics device driver, or the VLC media player; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels.  See also [http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441 O'Reilly article "Watch Videos in ASCII art"].

==Non fixed-width ASCII==
Most ASCII art is created using a [[monospace font]], where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier New]] is a popular monospace font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Arial]] or [[Times New Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

==Animated ASCII art==
Animated ASCII art started in 1970  from so-called VT100 animations produced on [[vt100]] terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.

==Other text-based art==
There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as "ASCII art". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or [[pseudo-graphics]].

===ANSI art===
{{Main|ANSI art}}
The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, 8 background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===
[[File:Mona01.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Monā'''|モナー|Monā}} Posted on {{nihongo|'''[[2ch]]'''|２ちゃんねる|Nichanneru}} in 2000]]
{{Main|Shift_JIS art}}
A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use [[Shift JIS]] as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode}}
[[Unicode]] would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺♫Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used.

===Overprinting (surprint)===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting &mdash; the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color
