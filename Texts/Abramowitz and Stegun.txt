'''''Abramowitz and Stegun''''' is the informal name of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] reference work edited by [[Milton Abramowitz]] and [[Irene Stegun]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now the ''National Institute of Standards and Technology'').  Its full title is '''''Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'''''.

Since it was first published in 1964, the 1046 page ''Handbook'' has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on [[special function]]s, containing definitions, identities, approximations, plots, and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of [[applied mathematics]].  The notation used in the ''Handbook'' is the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for much of applied mathematics today.

At the time of its publication, the ''Handbook'' was an essential resource for practitioners.  Nowadays, [[computer algebra system]]s have replaced the [[mathematical table|function tables]], but the ''Handbook'' remains an important reference source.  The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that "''the advent of high-speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables''".


==Editions==
Because the ''Handbook'' is the work of [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] employees acting in their official capacity, it is [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|not protected by copyright]].  While it can be ordered from the [[Government Printing Office]], it has also been reprinted by commercial publishers, most notably [[Dover Publications]] (ISBN 0-486-61272-4), and can be legally viewed and downloaded off the web.

==Successor==
A digital successor to the Handbook, long under development at NIST, was released as the “[[Digital library of mathematical functions]]” (DLMF) on May 11, 2010, along with a printed version, the ''NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions,'' published by [[Cambridge University Press]].(ISBN 9780521192255). More information can be found at [http://dlmf.nist.gov/ NIST].
