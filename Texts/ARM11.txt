'''ARM11''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[microprocessor]] family which introduced the ARMv6 architectural additions. These include  [[SIMD]] media instructions, [[multiprocessor]] support and a new cache architecture.  The implementation included significantly improved instruction processing pipeline, compared to previous [[ARM9]] or [[ARM10]] families, and is used in [[smartphones]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nokia]], and others.  The initial ARM11 core (ARM1136) was released to licensees in late 2002.

The ARM11 family are currently the only ARMv6-architecture cores.  There are however Thumb2-only ARMv6-M cores (Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M1), addressing [[microcontroller]] applications; ARM11 cores target more demanding applications.

==Differences from ARM9==
In terms of instruction set, the ARM11 builds on the preceding [[ARM9]] generation.  It incorporates all ARM926EJ-S features and adds the ARMv6 instructions for media support (SIMD) and accelerating IRQ response.


* SIMD instructions which can double [[MPEG-4]] and audio [[digital signal processing]] [[algorithm]] speed
* Cache is physically addressed, solving many cache aliasing problems and reducing context switch overhead
* Unaligned and mixed-endian data access is supported
* Reduced heat production and lower overheating risk
* Redesigned pipeline, supporting faster clock speeds (target up to 1 GHz)
** Longer: 8 stages vs 5
** Out-of-order completion
** Dynamic branch prediction/folding (like [[XScale]])
** Cache misses don't block execution of non-dependent instructions
** Load/Store parallelism
** [[arithmetic and logic unit|ALU]] parallelism
* [[64-bit]] data paths

[[JTAG]] debug support (for halting, stepping, breakpoints, and watchpoints) was simplified.  The EmbeddedICE module was replaced with an interface which became part of the ARMv7 architecture.  The hardware tracing modules (ETM and ETB) are compatible, but updated, versions of those used in the ARM9.  In particular, trace semantics were updated to address parallel instruction execution and data transfers.


==ARM11 cores==
There are currently four ARM11 cores:

* ARM1156 introducing Thumb2 instructions
* ARM1176 introducing security extensions
* ARM11MPcore introducing multicore support
