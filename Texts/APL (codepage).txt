==Character set==
APL has always been criticized for its choice of a unique, non-standard character set. The observation that some who learn it usually become ardent adherents shows that there is some weight behind [[Kenneth E. Iverson|Iverson]]'s idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices which could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the [[IBM]] [[Selectric]] print mechanism along with a special APL type element. Over time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic display, printing devices and [[Unicode]] support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated; however, the problem of entering APL characters requires the use of [[input method editor]]s or special keyboard mappings, which may frustrate beginners accustomed to other languages.

From a user's standpoint, the additional characters can give APL a special elegance and concision not possible in other languages, using symbols visually mnemonic of the functions they represent.  On the other hand, it can lead to a ridiculous degree of complexity and unreadability, like when the symbols are strung together into a single mass without any comments.  It can be unreasonably difficult and time consuming to enter then later edit those APL statements.


==Keyboard layout==
Note the mnemonics associating an APL character with a letter: ''question mark'' on ''Q'', ''power'' on ''P'', ''rho'' on ''R'', ''base value'' on ''B'', ''eNcode'' on ''N'', ''modulus'' on ''M'' and so on. This makes it easier for an English-language speaker to type APL on a non-APL keyboard providing one has visual feedback on one's screen. Also, decals have been produced for attachment to standard keyboards, either on the front of the keys or on the top of them.

Additional APL characters were available by [[Overstrike|overstriking]] one character over another.  For example, the ''log'' symbol was formed by overstriking shift-''P'' with shift-''O''.  This complicated correcting mistakes and editing program lines.  This may have ultimately been the reason for early APL programs to have a certain dense style - they were difficult to edit.

Many overstrikes, although appealing, are not actually used.  New overstrikes were introduced by vendors as they produced versions of APL tailored to specific hardware, system features, file system, and so on.  Further, printing terminals and early APL cathode-ray terminals were capable of displaying arbitrary overstrikes, but as personal computers rapidly replaced terminals as a data-entry device, APL character support was now provided as an ''APL Character Generator ROM'' or a soft character set rendered by the display device.  With the advent of Windows, APL characters were defined as just another complete font, thus the distinction between overstruck characters and standard characters having been eliminated.

Later IBM terminals, notably the [[IBM 3270]] display stations, had an alternate keyboard arrangement which is the basis for some of the modern APL keyboard layouts in use today.  Better terminals, namely display devices instead of printers, encouraged the development of better full screen editors, which had a measurable improvement in productivity and program readability.
