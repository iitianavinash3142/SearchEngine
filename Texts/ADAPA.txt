'''ADAPA''' is intrinsically a predictive decisioning platform. It combines the power of [[predictive analytics]] and [[business rules]] to facilitate the tasks of managing and designing automated decisioning systems. 

==Automated decisions==
When first released, ADAPA (Adaptive Decision And Predictive Analytics) was purely a scoring engine, used to produce scores out of [[statistical model]]s expressed in [[PMML]] (Predictive Model Markup Language) format. With the addition of a rules engine to its core, ADAPA is now able to seamlessly combine rules and predictive models, which enables businesses to manage and design automated decisioning systems. In this way, ADAPA allows for the concretization of [[Enterprise Decision Management]] (EDM) solutions.

==PMML support and predictive analytics==
[[Predictive analytics]] comprises a series of modeling techniques which can be used to extract relevant patterns present in large amounts of data to better predict the future.

ADAPA is able to generate scores out of a variety of predictive modeling techniques expressed in [[PMML]]. PMML provides a standard way for the expression of predictive models. In this way, proprietary issues and incompatibilities are no longer a barrier to the exchange of models between applications. 

Currently, ADAPA supports the following PMML elements:

[[File:ADAPA3.0 TwoinOne.png|right|350px|H3|]]

* [[Decision tree learning|Decision Trees]]
* [[Neural Networks]]
* Clustering Models
* Naive Bayes Classifiers
* [[Support Vector Machines]]
* Ruleset Models
* Linear and [[Logistic regression]] as well as all general regression PMML models:
** Multinomial Logistic
** General Linear
** Ordinal Multinomial
** Simple Regression
** [[Generalized linear model]]
** Cox Regression Models

as well as a variety of elements involved in data pre- and post-processing:

* Built-in Functions (logic and arithmetic operators as well as IF-THEN-ELSE)
* Normalization
* Discretization
* Value Mapping
* Functions
* Targets/Scaling
* Outputs
* Model Verification (which in ADAPA can also take the form of a CSV file)

Once a model is uploaded in ADAPA, it can be executed in batch and real-time. ADAPA is a PMML consumer, therefore it is able to execute PMML code exported from tools such as R, SPSS, IBM, SAS, KNIME, KXEN, RapidMiner, etc. 

Besides offering a web-based console to manage models and rule sets, ADAPA includes capabilities to test these under its decision and validation framework.

==Business rules==

[[Business rules]] allow for business process and logic to be expressed outside of programming code. With ADAPA, the integration of predictive analytics and rules is seamless. Simply put, ADAPA allows both data-driven and expert knowledge to be combined into a single and concise solution, executed in real-time or in batch-mode. 

ADAPA allows for business knowledge to be expressed in simple tabular format. In ADAPA, rules can be used to manage the execution of different predictive models depending on the business context. They can also incorporate scores generated by different predictive models throughout the business process. The acting together of the two technologies has the potential to significantly extend the precision of any decision logic. 

ADAPA rules leverage the power of the leading Java [[open-source]] rules engine [[Drools]] which is supported by a strong community of developers and JBoss, a division of [[Red Hat]]. This fast, highly efficient rules engine has proven its excellence in numerous commercial installations. 

All decisions in ADAPA are readily available by the use of [[Web Services]].

==ADAPA To Go==
===PMML Converter===
[[Zementis Inc]] (the maker of ADAPA) has released a PMML converter as an iGoogle gadget. This allows for users to convert older PMML models (versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2) to version 4.0. Besides schema validation, the PMML Converter automatically corrects known issues with PMML code from several sources/vendors. The aim is to successfully validate code in older versions of PMML and convert them to PMML 4.0. Files in PMML 4.0 can also be passed through the converter so that they can be corrected and validated against the 4.0 schema.

The PMML Converter is also embedded in ADAPA itself. And so, if you use ADAPA, there is no need to convert your files, ADAPA will automatically do that for you.

===Software as a Service on the Amazon Cloud===
ADAPA predictive analytics is available through the [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]] (Amazon EC2). It provides the first [[SaaS]] (Software as a Service) predictive decisioning platform. The user can upload and manage several rule sets as well as models expressed in PMML and score data in real-time through the use of web-service calls (ADAPA will automatically convert older versions of PMML to version 3.2 and correct any known issues from different vendors). ADAPA as a Service empowers people, since it allows for anyone anywhere to deploy and use state of the art data mining models.

===ADAPA Add-in for Microsoft Office Excel===
To make the process of executing predictive models even simpler, Zementis also offers the ADAPA add-in for Excel 2007 and 2010 (available for free). With the add-in, anyone in the enterprise is able to score data in Excel by executing models previously deployed in the Cloud.

ADAPA allows for real-time data scoring at any time a new event occurs since it can be used from inside any application via Web Service Calls. Excel is just one such application which happens to be a very well known tool (used by many). This is remarkable, since it frees users from having to deal with all the technology required for scoring their data whenever necessary. With the Excel add-in, all one has to do is to select which data records to score (or the columns and rows containing the relevant data) and pressing on the “Score” button in Excel … et voila’ … new predictions are generated automatically for all selected records.

==ADAPA Flavors==
ADAPA is currently being offered in two ways:
* [http://www.zementis.com/on-the-cloud.htm On the Cloud]: launch your own private instances of ADAPA on the Amazon Cloud.  
* [http://www.zementis.com/site-tour.htm On Site]: ADAPA is also available for deployment on site or on your private cloud.
