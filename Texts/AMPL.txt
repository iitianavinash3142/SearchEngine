'''AMPL''', an acronym for '''"A Mathematical Programming Language"''', is an [[algebraic modeling language]] for describing and solving high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computation (i.e. large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems)

It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], [[David Gay]] and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL does not solve problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external [[solver]]s (such as [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[MINOS (solver)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and so on) to obtain solutions. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl files]].


==Availability==

AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows]].

==Optimization problems supported==

AMPL handles a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables

==A sample model==

A transportation problem from [[George Dantzig]] is used to provide a sample AMPL model. This problem finds the least cost shipping schedule that meets requirements at markets and supplies at factories.
