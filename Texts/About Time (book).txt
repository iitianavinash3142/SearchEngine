'''''About Time''''' (ISBN 0-684-81822-1) is the second [[book]] written by [[Paul Davies]], regarding the subject of [[time]].  The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics.

Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time".

The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s.
