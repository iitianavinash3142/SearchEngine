'''Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Никола́евич Колмого́ров}}) (25 April 1903 – 20 October 1987) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russian [[mathematician]], preeminent in the 20th century, who advanced various scientific fields, among them [[probability theory]], [[topology]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[turbulence]], [[classical mechanics]] and [[computational complexity]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kolmogorov was born at [[Tambov]] in 1903. His unwed mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his aunts in [[Tunoshna]] near [[Yaroslavl]] at the estate of his grandfather, a wealthy nobleman. His father, an [[agronomist]] by trade, was deported from [[Saint-Petersburg]] for participation in the revolutionary movement. He disappeared and was presumed to have been killed in the [[Russian Civil War]]. 

Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt's village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school newspaper. As an adolescent he designed [[perpetual motion]] machines, concealing their (necessary) defects so cleverly that his secondary-school teachers could not discover them. In 1910, his aunt adopted him and then they moved to Moscow, where he went to a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], graduating from it in 1920. 

In 1920, Kolmogorov began to study at the [[Moscow State University]] and the Chemistry Technological Institute. 


===Maturity===
In 1922 Kolmogorov constructed a [[Convergence of Fourier series|Fourier series that diverges]] [[almost everywhere]], gaining international recognition. Around this time he decided to devote his life to [[mathematics]]. In 1925 Kolmogorov graduated from  [[Moscow State University]], and began to study under the supervision of [[Nikolai Luzin]]. He made lifelong friends with [[Pavel Alexandrov]] who involved Kolmogorov in 1936 in an ugly  political persecution of their common teacher, the so-called [[Luzin case]] or [[Luzin affair]]. Kolmogorov (together with [[Khinchin|A. Khinchin]]) became interested in [[probability theory]]. Also in 1925, he published his famous work in [[intuitionistic logic]] &mdash; ''On the principle of the excluded middle''. In 1929 Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree, [[Ph.D.]], at the [[Moscow State University]].


In his study of [[stochastic processes]] (random processes), especially [[Markov process]]es, Kolmogorov and the [[British people|British]] mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]]s.

Later on, Kolmogorov changed his research interests to the area of [[turbulence]], where his publications beginning in 1941 had a significant influence on the field. In [[classical mechanics]], he is best known for the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] (first presented in 1954 at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]). In 1957 he solved [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]] (a joint work with his student [[V. I. Arnold]]).  He was a founder of [[algorithmic complexity theory]], often referred to as [[Kolmogorov complexity|Kolmogorov complexity theory]], which he began to develop around this time.  

Kolmogorov was married to Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life, not only at the university level but also with younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children, in literature, and in music, as well as in mathematics. At the Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions, including the heads of several departments: [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[random process]]es; [[mathematical logic]]; and he also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.


Kolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987. A quotation, "Every mathematician believes he is ahead over all others. The reason why they don't say this in public, is because they are intelligent people" is attributed to him.
