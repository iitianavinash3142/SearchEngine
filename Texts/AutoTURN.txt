'''AutoTURN''' is a third-party 2-dimensional [[CAD]] [[software]] released for the [[AutoCAD]] or [[MicroStation]] platforms, developed and sold by [[Transoft Solutions Inc.]] AutoTURN software can only be used on computers that run [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Among a number of things, it analyses and simulates [[wiktionary:swept path|swept path]] vehicle maneuvers.

==History==


*In 1992, AutoTURN 2.0 was released and was the first released version of AutoTURN compatible with [[Bentley Systems]] [[MicroStation]] [[Unix]]. The libraries of vehicles available for [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swept_path/ swept path] [[simulation]] and analysis was limited and vehicle simulations could only be carried out in a forward direction. AutoTURN 2.0 was compatible with AutoCAD Release 10 and then [[Unix]] version of MicroStation V 3.4.

*AutoTURN 3.0 was released in [[1993]], less than 1 year after AutoTURN 2.0. The 3.0 release version of AutoTURN included many upgrades over its predecessor. This version of AutoTURN included larger vehicle libraries, and a supplement for use with aircraft (This supplement would become expanded into a separate software called AutoTURN Aircraft in [[1995]]). Among other improvements, AutoTURN 3.0 enabled users to run simultaneous [[simulation]]s of two vehicles in forward and reverse directions in a stop motion (frame by frame) animation. Simulations could only be done from pre-drawn paths.

*In [[2000]] the release of AutoTURN 4.0 accounted for international users, it was the first version of AutoTURN available in multiple languages. Among other improvements, AutoTURN 4.0 included expanded international libraries of vehicles. To incorporate the many new capabilities it was necessary to make significant changes to the program’s visual [[User interface|interface]] and functionality. The change in interface included a new [[toolbar]]. Generate simulation tools were introduced so users didn’t first have to draw the vehicle path in order to generate a simulation. AutoTURN 4 introduced the concepts of Active Path and Active Simulation allowing for repetition of various functions without repeated re-selecting of objects. Like the previous release versions, AutoTURN 4.0 contained a supplement for aircraft.

*AutoTURN 5.0’s release in 2004, among many other functions, introduced [[Heuristic]] [[algorithm]]s for tracking, creation of simulations on spline elements, and improved layer management for simulations. The standard vehicle library file was changed to a searchable [[database]] of vehicles based on international or custom standards. Adding to those features AutoTURN 5.1 introduces the ability to set Steering Linkage ratios between the front and rear steering axle groups. Additionally, in the 5.1 version could continuously loop simulations.

*The 2008 release of AutoTURN 6.0 added additional simulation functions. It builds on version 5.1’s abilities to loop simulations by adding the ability to export simulations to InVision (a separate software application) in order to create video clips. Plan view and chamfered vehicles can be used for simulations and or modified in this version.
