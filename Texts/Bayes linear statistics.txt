Practitioners of subjective Bayesian statistics routinely analyse datasets where the size of this set is large enough that subjective probabilities cannot be meaningfully determined for every element of ''D &times; B''.  This is normally accomplished by assuming [[exchangeability]] and then the use of parameterized models with prior distributions over parameters and appealing to the [[de Finetti's theorem]] to justify that this produces valid operational subjective probabilities over ''D &times; B''.  The difficulty with such an approach is that the 
validity of the statistical analysis requires that the subjective probabilities are a good representation of an individual's beliefs however this method results in a very precise specification over ''D &times; B'' and it is often difficult to articulate what it would mean to adopt these belief specifications.

In contrast to the traditional Bayesian paradigm Bayes linear statistics following de Finetti uses [[Prevision]] or subjective expectation as a primitive, probability is then defined as the expectation of an indicator variable.  Instead of specifying a subjective probability for every element in the partition ''D &times; B'' the analyst specifies subjective expectations for just a few quantities that they are interested in or feel knowledgeable about.  Then instead of conditioning an adjusted expectation is computed by a rule that is a generalization of Bayes' rule that is based upon expectation.

The use of the word linear in the title refers to de Finetti's arguments that probability theory is a linear theory (de Finetti argued against the more common measure theory approach).  
 

==Example==
In Bayes linear statistics, the probability model is only partially specified it is not possible to calculate conditional probability by Bayes' rule.  Instead Bayes linear suggests the calculation of an Adjusted Expectation.

To conduct a Bayes linear analysis it is necessary to identify some values that you expect to know shortly by making measurements ''D'' and some future value which you would like to know ''B''.  Here ''D'' refers to a vector containing data and ''B'' to a vector containing quantities you would like to predict.  For the following example ''B'' and ''D'' are taken to be two-dimensional vectors i.e.


In order to specify a Bayes linear model it is necessary to supply expectations for the vectors ''B'' and ''D'', and to also specify the correlation between each component of ''B'' and each component of ''D''.  

For example the expectations are specified as: 


and the covariance matrix is specified as :

\begin{matrix}
    &    X_1    &    X_2    &    Y_1    &    Y_2     \\
X_1 &      1    &    u      &    \gamma    &    \gamma     \\
X_2 &      u    &    1      &    \gamma    &    \gamma     \\
Y_1 &      \gamma  &    \gamma    &    1      &    v       \\
Y_2 &      \gamma  &    \gamma    &    v      &    1       \\
\end{matrix}.

The repetition in this matrix, has some interesting implications to be discussed shortly.

An adjusted expectation is a linear estimator of the form




where



In general the adjusted expectation is calculated with




From a proof provided in (Goldstein and Wooff 2007) it can be shown that:


For the case where Var(''D'') is not invertible the [[Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse]] should be used instead.
