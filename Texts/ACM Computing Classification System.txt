==History==
The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982,  1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998.

==Structure==
The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains
:I. Computing Methodologies, which contains:
::I.2 [[Artificial Intelligence]], which contains:
:::I.2.4 [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], which contains:
::::''[[Temporal logic]]''.

Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: "general", coded with a "0", and "miscellaneous", coded with a "m". For instance, I.0 denotes the "general" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory. Several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories.

|list1   = is for general computing literature. It includes subtopics for introductory and survey material, and for reference works.
|list2   =  on hardware, has subtopics for [[Control unit|control structures]] and [[Microcode|microprogramming]], [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic structures]], [[Computer storage|memory structures]], [[Input/output|input/output and data communications]], [[Register transfer level|register-transfer-level implementation]], [[logic design]], [[integrated circuit]]s, and [[Performance tuning|performance]] and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].
|list3   = concerns [[Computer organization|computer systems organization]]. The subtopics of this section are [[Central processing unit|processor architectures]], [[Computer networking|computer-communication networks]], special-purpose and application-based systems, [[Performance tuning|performance of systems]], and [[Implementation|computer system implementation]].
|list4   = is entitled [[Software]]. This section includes two subtopics on software development: programming techniques and [[software engineering]]. Two more subtopics concern the software infrastructure needed to run other software: [[programming language]]s and [[operating system]]s.
|list5   = pertains [[data]], includes subtopics on [[data structure]]s, data storage representations, [[Encryption|data encryption]], [[Coding theory|coding]] and [[information theory]], and [[Computer file|file]]s.
|list6   = includes several topics from the [[theory of computation]]: [[Abstract machine|computation by abstract devices]],  [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[Computational complexity theory|problem complexity]], [[Formal methods|logics and meanings of programs]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[formal language]]s.
|list7   = contains topics involving the mathematics of computing. Its subtopics are [[numerical analysis]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[probability and statistics]], and [[mathematical software]].
|list8   = pertains to [[information systems]]. It includes subtopics for models and principles, [[Database|database management]], information storage and [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], information systems applications, and information interfaces and presentation (e.g., [[Human-computer interaction|HCI]]).
|list9   = on computing methodologies, covers a diverse set of subtopics concerning different application areas of computation: [[Symbolic mathematics|symbolic and algebraic manipulation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer graphics]], [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], [[pattern recognition]], [[Computer simulation|simulation and modeling]], and [[Document processing|document and text processing]].
|list10  = also covers computer applications, but with a focus more on the different application areas and less on the different styles of computation one does in each of those areas. Its subtopics are administrative data processing, [[Scientific computing|physical sciences and engineering]], [[Bioinformatics|life and medical sciences]], social and behavioral sciences, [[Digital art|arts]] and [[The Digital Humanities|humanities]], [[computer-aided engineering]], and computers in other systems.
|list11  = has as its title Computing Milieux. The subtopics of this section are [[Computer industry|the computer industry]], [[History of computer science|history of computing]], [[Educational technology|computers and education]], computers and society, [[legal aspects of computing]], management of computing and information systems, the computing profession, and [[Personal computer|personal computing]].

In addition, papers in this repository are classified according to the ACM subject classification.
