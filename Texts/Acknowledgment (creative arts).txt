In the [[Creative Arts|creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgment''' (also spelled '''acknowledgement''') is an expression of gratitude for assistance in creating a literary or artistic work. 

Receiving [[credit (creative arts)|credit]] by way of acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s).  Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgments; Giles & Councill (2004) give the following six categories:
# [[moral support]]
# [[funding|financial support]]
# [[editing|editorial support]]
# [[presentation|presentational support]]
# [[technical support|instrumental/technical support]]
# [[conceptual support]], or [[peer interactive communication]] (PIC)
Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt.  Some acknowledgments of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution.
