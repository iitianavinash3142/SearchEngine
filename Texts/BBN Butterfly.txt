The Butterfly was initially developed as the [[Voice Funnel|VoiceFunnel]], a router for the ST-II protocol intended for carrying voice and video over wideband networks.  The Butterfly hardware was later used for the router of DARPA's high-speed descendant of ARPANET, the Satellite Wideband Network.  This network later became the Terrestrial Wideband Network.

The Butterfly began with a proprietary [[operating system]] called Chrysalis, but moved to a [[Mach kernel]] operating system in 1989. While the memory access time was non-uniform, the machine had SMP memory semantics, and could be operated as a symmetric multiprocessor.

The largest configured system with over 123 processors (extras for fault-tolerant redundancy) was delivered to the MPCI facility at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. Most delivered systems had about 16 processors. No known configurations appear to be in museums. At least one system is thought to be sitting within a [[DARPA]] autonomous vehicle.

[[TotalView]], the parallel program debugger developed for the Butterfly outlived the platform, to be ported to a number of other massively parallel machines.
